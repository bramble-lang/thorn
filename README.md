# Thorn Insight Tools Platform
Insight tools built off of the insight data generated when running the Braid compiler.

Instructions for each component are contained within the README's of the sub
directories.

Sample Braid insight data is contained in `./service/data`

## To Use Thorn
Thorn consists of two components: the Server and the Viewer. The Server
is a Rust service which runs from within your project directory and 
hosts the Thorn Insight data generated by the Bramble Compiler (this
data is stored in the `./target` directory). The Viewer is a React application
that connects to the Server and allows you to visualize and interact
with the Insight data.

### Install the Server
From within the `service` directory run
```
cargo install -- .
```

This will build a release version of the Server and install it in the
Rust binaries directory.  Allowing you to run the server from the command
line.

### Host Your Project
After installing the server, go to your projects root directory (where
you run the Bramble compiler from and where the output `./target` 
directory is).  Run `thorns` from that directory, it will automatically
load the Insights data from the `./target` directory and host it for
querying.

### Interact with Insights Data
After running the server, go to the `viewer` subdirectory of this project
and run `npm start` this will start the React GUI application which will
connect to the Thorn server and let you explore the insights data from
your project.
